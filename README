A script to copy a remote IMAP folder to a local maildir storage area.  Ideal
for incremental backups of mail from free webmail providers, or perhaps as an
alternative to fetchmail.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  Required options:
    -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
                        Username for authentication to IMAP server
    -d PATH, --destination=PATH
                        Destination maildir path, e.g. ~/Backups/Gmail

  Optional and debugging options:
    -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                        Password for IMAP server.  Default: prompt user
    -H HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
                        Hostname of IMAP server, default: imap.gmail.com
    -P PORT, --port=PORT
                        Port number.  Default: 993 (SSL), 143 (clear)
    -v, --verbose       Turns up the verbosity
    -q, --quiet         Quiets all output (except prompts and errors)
    -r FOLDERNAME, --remote-folder=FOLDERNAME
                        Remote IMAP folder.  Default: [Gmail]/All Mail
    --range-start=NUM   Start with seq NUM (0=high water mark).  Default: 0
    --range-end=NUM     End before seq NUM (0=all messages).  Default: 0
    --create            If --destination doesn't exist, create it
    -m MAX, --max-messages=MAX
                        Max messages to process in one run.  Default: 1000
    -c CONFIGFILE, --config-file=CONFIGFILE
                        Configuration file to use.  Default: imap2maildir.conf
    -C, --chunking      Enable chunking FETCH mode.  Default: False

  SSL-related options:
    By default, tries SSL first then cleartext.

    -S, --force-ssl     Require SSL to connect, default: False
    -s, --no-ssl        Don't use SSL to connect, default: will try SSL

COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
 $ imap2maildir -u bob@yourplace.com -d /home/bob/backups/mail --create
   Prompts you for bob@yourplace.com's password, uses the default mail server.
 $ imap2maildir -c blarf.conf
   Uses the configuration from blarf.conf
 $ imap2maildir -c something.conf -m 5000
   Uses the something.conf configuration, except with the max messages set to
   5000.

CHUNKING MODE?
There are two ways in which this script can interrogate the mail server
for a list of messages:
    Chunking Mode:
        Does one big fetch for all messages in a range, usually from the
        previous high water mark to max-messages beyond it.
        PRO: Really fast, especially when we already have a lot of the
             messages in the range, since it only needs to do one FETCH
             to get all the info it needs to check a bunch of messages.
        CON: Can use a lot of memory with larger ranges.  Also, if there's
             a problem somewhere along the line, it will barf all over
             the place.
    Iterating Mode (current default):
        Fetches each message header individually, like doing a chunking
        mode with max-messages equal to 1.
        PRO: Able to handle errors very well.  In the event you have a lot
             of messages to go through, it requires less memory.
        CON: Slower than chunking mode, since it requires a FETCH for each
             individual message.  Creates a fair bit of network traffic.
