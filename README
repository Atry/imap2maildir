Usage: imap2maildir [options]

A script to copy a remote IMAP folder to a local maildir storage area.  Ideal
for incremental backups of mail from free webmail providers, or perhaps as an
alternative to fetchmail.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  Required options:
    -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
                        Username for authentication to IMAP server
    -d PATH, --destination=PATH
                        Destination maildir path, e.g. ~/Backups/Gmail

  Optional and debugging options:
    -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                        Password for IMAP server.  Default: prompt user
    -H HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
                        Hostname of IMAP server, default: imap.gmail.com
    -P PORT, --port=PORT
                        Port number.  Default: 993 (SSL), 143 (clear)
    -v, --verbose       Turns up the verbosity
    -q, --quiet         Quiets all output (except prompts and errors)
    -r FOLDERNAME, --remote-folder=FOLDERNAME
                        Remote IMAP folder.  Default: [Gmail]/All Mail
    --create            If --destination doesn't exist, create it
    -m MAX, --max-messages=MAX
                        Max messages to process in one run (0=infinite).
                        Default: 0
    -c CONFIGFILE, --config-file=CONFIGFILE
                        Configuration file to use.  Default: imap2maildir.conf

  SSL-related options:
    By default, tries SSL first then cleartext.

    -S, --force-ssl     Require SSL to connect, default: False
    -s, --no-ssl        Don't use SSL to connect, default: will try SSL

COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
 $ imap2maildir -u bob@yourplace.com -d /home/bob/backups/mail --create
   Prompts you for bob@yourplace.com's password, uses the default mail server.
 $ imap2maildir -c blarf.conf
   Uses the configuration from blarf.conf
 $ imap2maildir -c something.conf -m 5000
   Uses the something.conf configuration, but overrides maxmessages to 5000.

CHANGES IN THE 2009/08/13 COMMIT
 * There is no more chunked vs. iterator mode choice.  It's all handled by
   generators in simpleimap.py.  This results in a little more network
   traffic, perhaps, but it results in improved stability.
 * There is no more high-water-mark logic.  Again, this improves stability
   for the sake of efficiency.  Note that the -m will no longer be quite
   as useful (or necessary) as it was before.
 * The range-start and range-end options are gone.
 * To make up for some of this, something called TURBO MODE has been added,
   which checks the local stash of messages for a particular uid before
   doing an IMAP FETCH for more info.  This can be turned off with the
   --turbo option if desired.

I think this is going to prove a lot more stable, especially for folks who
were running into MemoryError exceptions in imaplib.
